# FanMclaineBot
Code and Everything about FanMclaineBot "Mcbot"
Mcbot is a discord bot that is meant for Mcfan_#0751 as a personal bot but became a community bot
It is only joined in 3 Server (because it is a homemade bot) and right now, it got discontinued
The reason it discontinued is because of lack of confidence and lots of procrastination
But the bot is still online so dont worry, it hasnt been fully discontinued

# Why Python?
Well, python is the easiest language out there and since there is a discord.py library
Python also makes the code very well written tho
I just watched a bit of discord bot making tutorials and this is the aftermath!
